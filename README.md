Application READMEs
=======================

This repository stores the template we use at reInteractive for application README files.

Why?
-----------------------

Every Rails app follows many conventions on how to operate, but getting any new Rails app
installed and running can be a real pain if you don't have all the data you need to do
this.

At reInteractive we deal with dozens of Rails applications, and we use this README template
to make sure the critical information is captured.

What does it cover?
-----------------------

You can read the [entire README](https://github.com/reinteractive-open/default_readme/blob/master/DEFAULT_README.md)
with descriptions for a full review.  But in summary:

* Application Name Overview
* Required Environment / Minimum Setup
* Notable Deviations
* Accessing the Site
* Configuration
* Walkthrough / Smoke Test
* Testing
* Staging Environment
* Production Environment
* Design
* Known Issues / Gotcha
* Extended Resources

Each of these, when complete, gives a new developer a simple path to get the code installed and running
on their own system.  Makes life a lot easier.

Can we use it?
-----------------------

Of course!  Please!  The more apps that adopt this sort of README the easier it is for new
developers to get developing.  We release this under the [MIT License](https://github.com/reinteractive-open/default_readme/blob/master/MIT-LICENSE.txt).
